The name of this social media site is Persona because according to Wikipedia "A persona, according to the context, either is the public image of one's personality, 
or is the social role that one adopts, or is a fictional character. The word derives from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. 
On the social web, users develop virtual personas as online identities."

From Developer
This is Beta Version of Persona. This is my practice project, So it is not professional like other social media sites. 
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript(jQuery, Ajax), Python(Django Web Framework) and other open source libraries to create Persona.
